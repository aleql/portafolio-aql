## Notable Projects

### Eye-Search

**Gamified Web-Based Therapy for Hemianopia**

Eye-Search is a free, open, self-guided, web-based therapeutic intervention designed to support patients with hemianopia, a visual impairment caused by damage to visual processing areas of the brain. The condition frequently occurs after stroke, traumatic brain injury, or tumors and is often accompanied by visual neglect.

The objective of Eye-Search is to improve visual search speed and accuracy in real-world daily tasks by training compensatory strategies. The therapy does not restore lost visual fields but enhances the effective use of remaining vision through structured practice.

A major challenge in web-based therapies is long-term adherence. To address this, Eye-Search was designed as a gamified therapeutic system focused on engagement and motivation. Due to the lack of established guidelines for applying gamification to hemianopia therapy, we designed and implemented a custom gamification framework informed by game design and HCI literature.

The framework included:

* Intrinsic and extrinsic reward systems based on daily tasks, with in-game items to improve adherence and short-term engagement
* A non-player character (NPC) companion to increase social relatedness and user motivation
* Spaced practice mechanics to support motor skill learning and long-term retention

This project was developed as part of a research collaboration between the University of Chile and University College London.

**My role**

* Full-Stack Developer
* Gameplay Systems Developer
* UX Designer
* HCI Researcher

I led the technical development and redesign of the application, implemented gameplay and progression systems, conducted UX research, and contributed to study design and data analysis.

### Gamified Rehabilitation Applications for COANIQUEM

**Serious Games and VR for Pediatric Burn Rehabilitation**

COANIQUEM is a non-profit institution dedicated to the rehabilitation of children and adolescents with burn injuries. In collaboration with the University of Chile, two rehabilitation-focused applications were developed using gamification principles.

**Project 1: VR for Social Reintegration**
A virtual reality application designed to support social reintegration sessions by placing children in controlled simulated environments. The system allowed therapists to observe reactions, emotional responses, and behavioral patterns during rehabilitation exercises.

**Project 2: Gamified Joint Mobility Rehabilitation**
A video game designed to support children with joint mobility limitations resulting from burn injuries. The game captured joint range-of-motion data during play, providing therapists with measurable indicators to track patient progress while maintaining engagement.

Both projects were developed in close collaboration with rehabilitation specialists who validated design decisions and participated in iterative testing.

### Sinapp / Sinapp2D

**Educational Serious Game for Alzheimer’s Disease Prevention**

Sinapp2D is a mobile serious game developed for the GERO Institute in Chile. The game teaches children and the general audience about lifestyle habits that contribute to cognitive health and Alzheimer’s disease prevention.

The player maintains and expands a neuronal network over the lifespan of a character by balancing four core activities:

* Physical exercise
* Reading
* Sports
* Healthy diet

Each activity affects gameplay systems differently, reinforcing the educational message through mechanics rather than exposition.
